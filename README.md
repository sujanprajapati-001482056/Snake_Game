# Snake_Game
Today on 17thMay, 2025 I have built a Classic Snake Game using Python where I have learned to Manage real-time events in Python using turtle and ontimer,coordination-based movements and object collision and the importance of clean logic and smooth screen updates in game design.

üìù Project Highlights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Implemented the core game logic with turtle graphics for smooth rendering.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Added randomized food spawning and collision detection to mimic the classic gameplay.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ensured smooth directional changes and screen wrapping for uninterrupted play.

Playing this game brings a bit of nostalgia to everyone's life!
